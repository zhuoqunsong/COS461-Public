    "Network operators look at different types of network traffic data to understand properties of their networks. Some network data can be collected directly from network devices (e.g., routers, switches) while they are forwarding live traffic.  Collecting this data does not affect network behavior and is therefore called \"passive\" (as opposed to \"active\" measurements).\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traffic Measurement with IPFIX\n",
    "\n",
    "Routers in most networks collect traffic measurements using the [IPFIX protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Flow_Information_Export). [NetFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetFlow), a proprietary form of IPFIX defined by Cisco, is well-known in the networks community because Cisco supplies routers for many large networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the assignment, you'll analyze a trace of NetFlow records captured from a router that connects the Princeton campus network to the Internet. The assignment will ask you to perform similar kinds of analysis that a network operator would perform -- asking questions about the most popular endpoints for traffic on the Princeton campus, the most popular web applications, and so forth. (As you can imagine, when we start to think about security, the ability to analyze these baselines will come in handy!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow records are in the file 'netflow.csv' in the `assignment4` folder.  To simplify the analysis, we have ensured that the IP addresses of the Princeton campus network start with 128.112 and have their 16 lower bits anonymized to protect the privacy of users on the campus network (i.e., all of us!). To further simplify your task, we have parsed these records into CSV (comma-separated variable) format, with the names of the fields listed in the first row of the file. (In a real network, routers export IPFIX records as binary files.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement of Interdomain Routing with BGP Routing Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "To help network operators understand the state of Internet routing, many routers have the ability to \"dump\" BGP routing tables periodically into a static file. These routing tables contain information about each IP prefix, all BGP routes that the router learns for each prefix, and the \"best\" BGP route that the router ultimately selects. Analyzing the BGP routing tables can provide information about where traffic to different IP prefixes is destined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we have provided you a routing table dump from a project called RouteViews (http://www.routeviews.org/). You can visit that site to learn more about the routing tables that they collect. `telnet route-views2.routeviews.org` will also give you a command-line prompt at a real BGP router at the routeviews project if you want to play around with a live routing table view.  http://routeviews.org/bgpdata/ has periodic binary routing table dumps and update logs from participating routers. Again, for this assignment, we have parsed the binary routing table dumps into a format that is easier to analyze directly. The data is located in the `bgp_rib.csv` file in the `assignment4` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional data analysis with map() and reduce()\n",
    "\n",
    "Several of the data analysis steps in this assignment use a \"MapReduce\" programming model. MapReduce originated in functional programming languages and involves using two functions (called `map()` and `reduce()`...surprise!) to apply functions to iterable data (like linked-lists, arrays, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### map()\n",
    "\n",
    "A general `map()` function has two arguments: another function (which itself takes one argument) and an iterable object. `map()` then applies (maps) the argument function to every item in the iterable object. See the documentation of Python's built-in `map()`function for more details: https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#map. The following toy example uses `map()` to add 3 to every element of a list"

The function is then applied to this return value and the next item in the iterable object. This continues through the iterable object until only a single return value remains. This allows `reduce()` to compute summaries over all data in the iterable object.

    "\n",
    "What application protocols do you think are the most common on the Princeton network?  Web traffic (HTTP & SSL)? Secure remote connection (SSH)? Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)?  In practice, a network operator may want to identify popular applications  to make provisioning plans or change network configurations to treat traffic from different applications differently (e.g., to route traffic on different links). This could prevent high-volume applications, (e.g. video streaming) from interrupting the performance of critical low-volume applications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can answer these questions by finding the most popular ports of traffic flows in the netflow data. Many application protocols use well-known fixed ports for their traffic.  For example, HTTP traffic happens on port 80, SSL traffic on port 443, SSH traffic on port 22, SMTP on port 25. \n",

From our previous lectures on peering and Internet business relationships, it should be clear why an operator might care about knowing which ASes are sending traffic its way!
